Steps to Run the Java Code on Another System
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on the target system. The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and tools for developing Java applications.

Windows:

Download and install the JDK from the Oracle JDK download page or use OpenJDK.
Follow the installation instructions and set up the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
macOS:

Install the JDK using Homebrew:
bash
Copy code
brew install openjdk
Alternatively, download and install it from the Oracle website or OpenJDK.
Linux:

Install the JDK using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
2. Set Up Project Structure
Create a directory for your Java project and place the Java source file inside it.

plaintext
Copy code
my-java-project/
│
└── src/
    └── ShamirSecretSharing.java
3. Include Dependencies
The code uses the org.json library for JSON parsing. You need to include this dependency in your project.

Download the org.json Library:

Download the JAR file from the Maven Central Repository or another reliable source.
Place the JAR file in your project directory, for example, lib/org.json-20210307.jar.
Add the JAR to Your Classpath: When compiling and running the Java code, include the JAR file in the classpath.

4. Compile the Java Code
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the src directory of your project. Compile the Java code using the javac command.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/my-java-project/src
javac -cp ../lib/org.json-20210307.jar ShamirSecretSharing.java
The -cp option specifies the classpath to include the org.json library JAR file.
This command generates a ShamirSecretSharing.class file in the src directory.
5. Run the Java Program
Execute the compiled Java program using the java command, specifying the classpath to include the org.json library JAR file.

bash
Copy code
java -cp .:../lib/org.json-20210307.jar ShamirSecretSharing
On Windows, use ; instead of : to separate classpath entries:
bash
Copy code
java -cp .;../lib/org.json-20210307.jar ShamirSecretSharing
6. Verify Output
The program will output the calculated constant term based on the provided JSON input.

Additional Notes
IDE Setup: If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code, you can import the project and configure the dependencies through the IDE's project settings.
Automation: For large projects or frequent deployments, consider using build tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and build processes.
JSON Input: Ensure that the JSON input string in the code matches the format of the test cases you want to evaluate. You can modify the jsonString variable as needed.
By following these steps, you can compile and run the Java code on any system with the required JDK and dependencies.
